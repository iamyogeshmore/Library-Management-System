# Library-Management-System

- [ ] The Library Management System is a program that simplifies the management of books and borrowers in a library.
- [ ] It allows users to add books and borrowers, search for books, borrow and return books, generate reports, and view available books.
- [ ] The system aims to streamline library operations and ensure efficient book tracking and borrower management.
- [ ] The code modifications include the implementation of methods to save books and borrowers to the database, borrow and return books, and generate reports based on the stored data.
- [ ]  Additionally, the 'createTables()' method has been added to handle the creation of database tables, including dropping and recreating the 'books' table on each run to ensure a fresh start.
- [ ] This integration enables the Library Management System to persist data in a relational database, improving data management, scalability, and providing the foundation for future enhancements such as advanced querying, data analysis, and reporting capabilities.
